# TeamEverest - Project "Open Park" -- UDHYAM HACKATHON
---
# Project Description
---
"Open Park" is a web-based application aimed at tackling the challenges of urban parking systems, with a primary focus on addressing parking issues in areas like Kathmandu. The project is designed to cater to three distinct types of users:
---
# Super Admin
---
This privileged user has comprehensive access to all functions within the application and oversees the entire system's operation and data management.
---
# House Owners
---
House owners can create profiles within the application, providing details about their available parking spaces. They have the opportunity to rent out their parking spaces to end customers, thereby utilizing their private property and earning income.
---
# End Customers
---
End customers are users seeking parking solutions. They can use the application to:

Search for available parking spaces in specific areas.
Book parking spaces for desired durations.
Receive QR codes for access.
Make payments securely through the app.
Key features and functionalities of "Open Park" include:

1. Search and Booking
End customers can easily search for parking spaces in specific areas, book them for their desired durations, and receive QR codes for access.

2. Feedback System
Users can provide feedback on parking spaces, allowing for continuous improvement and quality control.

3. Parking Management
One of the primary functions of the project is managing previously unmanaged parking spaces in urban areas.

4. Payment Integration
The application facilitates secure payments for parking fees, streamlining the transaction process for both house owners and end customers.

5. Commission Model
House owners pay a commission fee to the Super Admin for using the application, ensuring a source of revenue for the platform.

6. Data Management
Super Admin has access to comprehensive data, including parking history and details of house owners, enabling efficient management of the application.

7. Profit Generation
"Open Park" aims to create a win-win situation:

House owners can monetize their parking spaces.
End customers can find convenient parking solutions.
The Super Admin earns revenue through commissions.
The success of this application relies on effective collaboration between house owners, end customers, and the Super Admin, ultimately making urban parking more accessible and efficient in areas like Kathmandu.
